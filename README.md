To get the repository and install it, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Qaidsaher/Support-Innovative-Project-Client.git
```

Replace `https://github.com/Qaidsaher/Support-Innovative-Project-Client.git` with the actual repository URL. This command will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Support-Innovative-Project-Client
```


### 3. Install Dependencies

After navigating to the project folder, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file, including Vite and React, along with any other required packages.

### 4. Verify Installation

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the application in development mode. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to verify that everything is working correctly.
